The hourly energy consumption dataset was cleaned by converting the Datetime column into a proper datetime format and setting it as the index to enable time-series operations. Duplicate timestamps were handled by aggregating demand values using the mean to ensure a unique time index. The dataset was then enforced to a continuous hourly frequency, and missing timestamps were addressed using forward fill to maintain temporal continuity. Finally, the hourly data was aggregated into daily average energy demand to reduce noise and prepare the dataset for forecasting. The cleaned dataset was saved as cleaned_daily_energy_data.csv.
