## Data Cleaning
The customer segmentation analysis was performed using the Train.csv dataset from Kaggle. The dataset initially contained 8,068 observations with several missing values across multiple columns. To ensure consistency and reliability for clustering analysis, all rows containing missing values were removed using the dropna() method, resulting in a cleaned dataset of 6,665 observations. The Family_Size variable was converted from a floating-point format to an integer to correctly represent count data. Since clustering algorithms require numerical inputs, the categorical variable Spending_Score was transformed into numeric form using Label Encoding, creating a new column named Spending_Score_Encoded. Relevant features for segmentation, namely Age, Work_Experience, Family_Size, and Spending_Score_Encoded, were selected based on their relevance to customer behavior and demographics. These features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that all variables contributed equally to the distance calculations in the K-Means clustering algorithm. The final cleaned dataset contains no missing values, consistent data types, and is fully prepared for clustering and customer segmentation analysis.
